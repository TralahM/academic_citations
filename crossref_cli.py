def search_works(args):
    """
    Returns a list of all works (journal articles, conference proceedings, books, components, etc), 20 per page.

    Queries:
        Free form search queries can be made, for example, works that include renear or ontologies (or both):

            /works?query=renear+ontologies
        Field Queries:
            Field queries allow for queries that match only particular fields of metadata. For example, this query matches records that contain the tokens richard or feynman (or both) in any author field:

            /works?query.author=richard+feynman
            Field queries can be combined with the general query parameter and each other. Each query parameter is ANDed with the others:

            /works?query.title=room+at+the+bottom&query.author=richard+feynman
            This endpoint supports the following field queries:

            query.affiliation - query contributor affiliations
            query.author - query author given and family names
            query.bibliographic - query bibliographic information, useful for citation look up, includes titles, authors, ISSNs and publication years
            query.chair - query chair given and family names
            query.container-title - query container title aka. publication name
            query.contributor - query author, editor, chair and translator given and family names
            query.degree - query degree

            query.title - query title
            query.translator - query translator given and family names

        Sort:
        Results can be sorted by applying the sort and order parameters. sort sets the field by which results will be sorted. order sets the result ordering, either asc or desc (default is desc).

        An example that sorts results in order of publication, beginning with the least recent:

            /works?query=josiah+carberry&sort=published&order=asc
        This endpoint supports sorting by the following elements:

            created - sort by created date
            deposited - sort by time of most recent deposit
            indexed - sort by time of most recent index
            is-referenced-by-count - sort by number of times this DOI is referenced by other Crossref DOIs
            issued - sort by issued date (earliest known publication date)
            published - sort by publication date
            published-online - sort by online publication date
            published-print - sort by print publication date
            references-count - sort by number of references included in the references section of the document identified by this DOI
            relevance - sort by relevance score
            score - sort by relevance score
            updated - sort by date of most recent change to metadata, currently the same as deposited

        Facets:
        Facet counts can be retrieved by enabling faceting. Facets are enabled by providing facet field names along with a maximum number of returned term values. The larger the number of returned values, the longer the query will take. Some facet fields can accept a * as their maximum, which indicates that all values should be returned.

        For example, to get facet counts for all work types:

            /works?facet=type-name:*
            This endpoint supports the following facets:

            affiliation - author affiliation
            archive - archive location
            assertion - custom Crossmark assertion name
            assertion-group - custom Crossmark assertion group name
            category-name - category name of work
            container-title - [max value 100], work container title, such as journal title, or book title
            funder-doi - funder DOI
            funder-name - funder literal name as deposited alongside DOI
            issn - [max value 100], journal ISSN (any - print, electronic, link)
            journal-issue - journal issue number
            journal-volume - journal volume
            license - license URI of work
            link-application - intended application of the full text link
            orcid - [max value 100], contributor ORCID
            published - earliest year of publication
            publisher-name - publisher name of work
            relation-type - relation type described by work or described by another work with work as object
            ror-id - institution ROR ID
            source - source of the DOI
            type-name - work type name, such as journal-article or book-chapter
            update-type - significant update type

        Filters:
        Filters allow you to select items based on specific criteria. All filter results are lists.

        For example:

            /works?filter=type:dataset
            Multiple filters
            Multiple filters can be specified in a single query. In such a case, different filters will be applied with AND semantics, while specifying the same filter multiple times will result in OR semantics - that is, specifying the filters:

            is-update:true
            from-pub-date:2014-03-03
            funder:10.13039/100000001
            funder:10.13039/100000050
            would locate documents that are updates, were published on or after 3rd March 2014 and were funded by either the National Science Foundation (10.13039/100000001) or the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (10.13039/100000050). These filters would be specified by joining each filter together with a comma:

                /works?filter=is-update:true,from-pub-date:2014-03-03,funder:10.13039/100000001,funder:10.13039/100000050
            Dot filters
            A filter with a dot in its name is special. The dot signifies that the filter will be applied to some other record type that is related to primary resource record type. For example, with work queries, one can filter on works that have an award, where the same award has a particular award number and award-giving funding agency:

                /works?filter=award.number:CBET-0756451,award.funder:10.13039/100000001
            Here we filter on works that have an award by the National Science Foundation that also has the award number CBET-0756451.

            Note on dates
            The dates in filters should always be of the form YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM or YYYY. The date filters are inclusive. For example:

                from-pub-date:2018-09-18 filters works published on or after 18th September 2018
                from-created-date:2016-02-29,until-created-date:2016-02-29 filters works first deposited on 29th February 2016
                until-created-date:2010-06 filters works first deposited in or before June 2010
                from-update-date:2017,until-update-date:2017 filters works with metadata updated in 2017
            Also note that date information in Crossref metadata can often be incomplete. So, for example, a publisher may only include the year and month of publication for a journal article. For a monograph they might just include the year. In these cases the API selects the earliest possible date given the information provided. So, for instance, if the publisher only provided 2013-02 as the published date, then the date would be treated as 2013-02-01. Similarly, if the publisher only provided the year 2013 as the date, it would be treated at 2013-01-01.

        Note on owner prefixes
            The prefix of a Crossref DOI does NOT indicate who currently owns the DOI. It only reflects who originally registered the DOI. Crossref metadata has an prefix element that records the current owner of the Crossref DOI in question.

            Crossref also has member IDs for depositing organisations. A single member may control multiple owner prefixes, which in turn may control a number of DOIs. When looking at works published by a certain organisaton, member IDs and the member routes should be used.

        Notes on incremental metadata updates
                When using time filters to retrieve periodic, incremental metadata updates, the from-index-date filter should be used over from-update-date, from-deposit-date, from-created-date and from-pub-date. The timestamp that from-index-date filters on is guaranteed to be updated every time there is a change to metadata requiring a reindex.

            This endpoint supports the following filters:

                alternative-id - metadata for records with the given alternative ID, which may be a publisher-specific ID, or any other identifier a publisher may have provided

        Elements
        Crossref metadata records can be quite large. Sometimes you just want a few elements from the schema. You can "select" a subset of elements to return using the select parameter. This can make your API calls much more efficient. For example:

            /works?select=DOI,prefix,title
        This endpoint supports selecting the following elements.

        Pagination with offsets
            Offsets are an easy way to iterate over results sets up to 10,000 items. This limit applies to the sum of values of parameters offset + rows.

            The number of items returned in a single response is controlled by rows parameter (default is 20, and maximum is 1,000). To limit results to 5, for example, you could do the following:

            /works?query=allen+renear&rows=5
        offset parameter can be used to retrieve items starting from a specific index of the result list. For example, to select the second set of 5 results (i.e. results 6 through 10), you would do the following:

            /works?query=allen+renear&rows=5&offset=5

        Deep paging:
            Deep paging using cursors can be used to iterate over large result sets, without any limits on their size.

            To use deep paging make a query as normal, but include the cursor parameter with a value of *, for example:

            /members/311/works?filter=type:journal-article&cursor=*
            A next-cursor field will be provided in the JSON response. To get the next page of results, pass the value of next-cursor as the cursor parameter (remember to URL-encode). For example:

                /members/311/works?filter=type:journal-article&cursor=<value of next-cursor parameter>
            Clients should check the number of returned items. If the number of returned items is equal to the number of expected rows then the end of the result set has been reached. Using next-cursor beyond this point will result in responses with an empty items list.

        Sample:
            Being able to select random results is useful for both testing and sampling. You can use the sample parameter to retrieve random results. So, for example, the following selects 10 random works:

            /works?sample=10
            Note that when you use the sample parameter, the rows and offset parameters are ignored.

        Parameter combinations:
            Any combination of query, query.*, filter, facet, select and sort can be used with offsets. Sampling cannot be combined with offsets.

            Any combination of query, query.*, filter, facet, select and sort may also be used with deep paging cursors. rows may also be specified.
